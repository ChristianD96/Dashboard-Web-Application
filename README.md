# Dashboard-Web-Application

About the Project/Project Title
Grazioso Salvare Dashboard Web Application
The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard Web Application performs query operations on a MongoDB database using interactive buttons. These buttons allow a user to break down a database filled with thousands of animals into specific rescue types with a shelter location map as well as a pie chart demonstrating the percentage of each breed type for the given rescue required.   

Motivation
This project was created so that the users at Grazioso Salvare could identify dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. We wanted to create an interactive experience that allowed a user to easily search their database from a dashboard that is straightforward and easy to understand. We wanted our client to search for the rescue animal easily and effectively they required. 

Getting Started
To begin searching and finding appropriate rescue animals within the database start by downloading the zipped file containing the necessary files. Upload the Austin Animal Center Outcomes data set into MongoDB by importing the downloaded CSV file. With everything set up correctly you should now be able to use the dashboard application named ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb and interact with the buttons.

Installation
You should only need a few simple tools to access the mentioned software. You will need Python and Mongo. You can install Python and Mongo both by searching for them in your web browser and following the logical steps provided. 

Tools used and why
MongoDB was used in the development of this project because its NOSQL structure allowed us to easily create different queries based on current and possible future customer needs. Our data was stored in a way that is not relational making it easy to separate and work with. Additionally, because we used python, we were able to achieve this dashboard web application using 100% python language simplifying the experience for not only the developers, but the client as well.
Steps taken
The first step taken to complete this project involved setting up the Mongo animal database and structuring it into a desirable format, so fields of each input were properly organized. After the data was organized, I created a .py file that implemented creating, reading, updating, and deleting(CRUD) within the database. Once this was all set up, I was able to quickly put together a dashboard that implemented callbacks to the CRUD functions for pulling certain data from the database dependent on user button selections. The buttons would result in a filtered data table fitting user selection, a pie chart demonstrating the percentage of each breed type within that filter and a map showing the locations of selected elements. 

Challenges
The primary challenges encountered during this project was the overall setup of the dashboard applications because it was so new to me. I had a difficult time getting the different features to layout correctly on the dash. 

Roadmap/Features
Although this dashboard is close to being finished, I am experiencing a few issues displaying all the coded functionality. Please hold on while we attempt to fix the issues. Please feel free to reach out to the email below if you come across any issues with the project providing screenshots and detailed explanations of the problems you encounter. Enjoy!
